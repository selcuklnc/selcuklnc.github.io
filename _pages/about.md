PhD-trained science educator and software engineer who fuses rigorous research with cutting-edge technology to elevate STEM learning from K-12 classrooms to university lecture halls. I design AI-driven tutoring systems, IoT sensor networks, and data-rich dashboards that transform abstract scientific concepts into hands-on investigationsâ€”most recently through a 16-week, Arduino-powered agriculture unit in rural Texas.

My portfolio spans peer-reviewed publications (published and in progress) that include an ethical AI assessment framework, book chapters, and conference proceedings. I also contribute to some grant proposals, some of which are currently in progress.

A seasoned mentor and professional-development leader, I have coached IB science teachers, supervised research assistants, and co-taught courses on qualitative methods, advanced analytics, and generative AI. I serve as a journal and conference reviewer, ensuring high standards across the field. Whether coordinating interdisciplinary teams or translating learning-sciences insights into classroom practice, I consistently deliver practitioner-friendly solutions that boost computational thinking, environmental literacy, and equitable access to future-ready STEM education.
